### Initial Project Setup Complete
**Date:** 7/10/2025

**Changes Made:**
1. Created `sampleProj` directory structure
2. Added `tasks/todo.md` for project task tracking
3. Created `main.py` with basic Python application entry point
4. Established simple project foundation ready for development

**Project Structure:**
```
sampleProj/
├── main.py           # Main application entry point
└── tasks/
    └── todo.md       # Task tracking and project notes
```

**Next Steps:**
- Define specific application requirements
- Set up virtual environment if needed
- Add functionality to main.py based on project goals

**Notes:**
- Project follows simplicity principle with minimal initial structure
- Ready for Python development with basic foundation in place
